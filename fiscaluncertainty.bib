  title="Uncertain Fiscal Consolidations",
  journal="Economic Journal",
  volume=123,
  pages="F31-F63",
  year=2013,

  abstract="This article explores the macroeconomic consequences of fiscal consolidations whose timing and
composition – either tax–or spending– based – are uncertain. We find that the composition of the
fiscal consolidation, its duration, the monetary policy stance, the level of government debt, and
expectations over the likelihood and composition of fiscal consolidations all matter in determining
the extent to which a given consolidation is expansionary or successful in stabilising government
debt. We argue that the conditions that could render fiscal consolidation efforts expansionary are
unlikely to apply in the current economic environment.",

  annote="Uncertainty regarding the timing and composition (whether spending-based or tax-based) of fiscal consolidations slows down economic activity.  Fiscal consolidations may occur at low or high frequencies, but as debt levels get higher, consolidation becomes more likely and with greater magnitude.  When forming expectations under uncertainty, economic agents do not rule out the possibility for undesireable conditions and compositions for the next fiscal consolidations, and they react to these expectations immediately, causing a slow down in economic activity.  It is possible that eventual fiscal consolidations are expansionary, but only to the extent that the policy finally realized removes the uncertainty that preceeded it and contractionary pressure that accompanied it."

  title="The consequences of uncertain debt targets",
  note="Working Paper",
  month="December",
  year=2013,

  abstract="Recent proposals to reduce U.S. debt reveal large differences in their implied targets. These
differences demonstrate the uncertainty surrounding future tax rates and long-run debt targets.
We use a standard real business cycle model in which a Bayesian household learns about the
state-dependent debt target in an endogenous tax rule. The household extracts the debt target
state from a noisy tax process and jointly estimates the transition probabilities. We compare
the household’s ability to learn and the consequences of the uncertainty across different limited
information sets. Limited information influences the household’s behavior but also imposes
two-sided risk. Despite the popular viewpoint that fiscal uncertainty has negative effects, lim-
ited information can result in welfare gains or losses, depending on whether the household’s
expectations are consistent with the realization of future states. Although the welfare distri-
bution includes gains, we stress that the uncertainty created by the recent fiscal policy debate
slowed the current recovery and led to welfare losses. If Congress credibly commits to a future
debt target, output and welfare increase and the economy quickly recovers.",
  
  annote="With uncertain fiscal debt targets, agents learn about the state for the debt target and the transition matrix.  When agents underestimate the debt target, and therefore overestimate the flow of taxes, they underinvest relative to what they would do under certainty.  This is likely what happened preceeding the debate on extending the Bush-era tax cuts, and this likely had a dampening effect on the recovery from the most recent recession."

  title="'Unfunded liabilities' and uncertain fiscal financing",
  journal="Journal of Monetary Economics, Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy",
  volume=57,
  pages="600-619",
  year=2010,

  abstract="We develop a rational expectations framework to study the consequences of alternative means to resolve the 'unfunded liabilities' problem---unsustainable exponential growth in federal Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending with no plan to finance it. Resolution requires specifying a probability distribution for how and when monetary and fiscal policies will change as the economy evolves through the 21st century. Beliefs based on that distribution determine the existence of and the nature of equilibrium. We consider policies that in expectation combine reaching a fiscal limit, some distorting taxation, modest inflation, and some reneging on the government's promised transfers. In the equilibrium, inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot successfully anchor expected inflation. Expectational effects are always present, but need not have large impacts on inflation and interest rates in the short and medium runs.",

  annote="With unsustainable exponential forecasts for the costs for entitlement programs, uncertainty exists for how the government will respond.  There is a fiscal limit: either the government is politically unable to raise taxes to a sufficient level to fund these liabilities or a laffer curve exists for tax revenue that makes it impossible.  Two outcomes are possible: the government reneges on its promises or passive monetary policy lets inflation diminish the real net present value of these liabilities.  While the cost of entitlement programs progress along an unsustainable path and traditional monetary and fiscal policies are still followed (monetary policy targets inflation and tax rates rise to fund liabilities), the probability of a change in regime becomes more likely, and uncertainty exists whether it will be a regime of passive monetary policy or passive fiscal policy, the latter implying a renegging on entitlement promises.  The positive probability of the former creates an expectation of higher inflation for the future, and a realization of higher inflation in the present.  Higher expected inflation suppresses macroeconomic activity, as does active monetary policy while it is still being pursued.  Even while monetary policy is active, it is unable to overcome these expectational effects."
